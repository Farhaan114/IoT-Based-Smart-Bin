METHODOLOGY: 

1.	Hardware Setup: Begin by connecting the necessary components, including the PIR sensor, ultrasonic sensors, and servo motor, to the appropriate pins on the Arduino board. Ensure proper wiring and connections for reliable operation.

2.	Initialization: In the setup phase, initialize the system by configuring the necessary settings and pin modes. This includes initializing serial communication for debugging or monitoring purposes and setting the pin modes for the PIR sensor, ultrasonic sensors, and servo motor.

3.	Sensing and Data Acquisition: Implement the functionality to sense and acquire data from the sensors. This involves reading the distance measurements from the ultrasonic sensors and detecting motion using the PIR sensor. Use appropriate techniques, such as pulse timing or digital signal reading, to gather accurate sensor data.

4.	Data Processing and Decision Making: Process the sensor data to make informed decisions. For instance, analyze the distance measurements from the ultrasonic sensors to determine the fill level of the dustbin. Evaluate the PIR sensor output to detect any motion in the vicinity of the dustbin. Use suitable algorithms or thresholds to interpret the sensor data effectively.

5.	Feedback and Control: Provide feedback and control mechanisms based on the data analysis results. For example, if the dustbin is determined to be filled, generate an alert or message indicating that it cannot be opened. Conversely, if motion is detected and the dustbin is not filled, activate the servo motor to open the dustbin lid. Control the servo motor's position and duration based on the specific requirements of the system.

6.	System Loop: Design the system to operate in a loop, continuously performing the sensing, data processing, decision making, and control steps. This ensures real-time monitoring and responsiveness to changes in the environment.

7.	Integration and Deployment: Integrate the developed code with the Arduino board and necessary hardware components. Ensure proper connections and test the system's functionality thoroughly. Deploy the IoT-based smart dustbin system in the desired location, considering factors such as power supply, connectivity, and user interaction.
